# Megafonito App Project

This is a school announcements/notices app developed using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/), [Deno](https://deno.com/), [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) and future services to be implemented.

We believe in making communication simpler, which this app intends to achieve.

## ü¶á Where we're at now

We are completely redesigning the UI, therefore the backend services have been put on a pause for now, that said, in order to **take a look** at the app, you may _clone the repo,_ and execute:

```bash
flutter create .
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

Due to the **lack of Apple machines** in the team, development has been focused only on Android for now.

## ü§ù How could you contribute?

- For any **frontend contributions**, you may:
  Upload a pdf file into the _UX/UI folder_ as well as a pull request with changes and implementations clearly explained
- For any **backend contributions**, you may:
  Create a detailed pull request in which you explain in a detailed manner how and why these changes are beneficial to the project, most importantly, how they will **keep being useful as the project scales**

We understand this project is still on its bare bones, but that's how every project comes to life, isn't it? That's where the fun of building lies!!!
